Dubbed as the "Hello World" of datasets, MNIST represents one of the most fundamental resources in machine learning. 

In this notebook, we will walk you through the process of building a **convolutional neural network** to predict handwritten digits. Specifically, we will learn how to build a **LeNet-5** model from scratch! 

If you're up for it, we can take a step further by applying various techniques to reduce overfitting and improve performance.

## Getting Started

These steps will guide you in running the project on your own computer.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10.8
